          <p><strong><strong>The Experience</strong></strong><br />
yall i love rice cakes. u don't understand. its the only thing I've ever craved when I'm abroad. its almost on-par with corn, and that says a lot. royal rice cake is my favorite way to make them because they are flavorful but nOT spicy. as much as I like Korean food, spice really kill me... sorry I will never be fully cultured...</p>        </div>
