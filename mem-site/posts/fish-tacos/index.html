          <p><strong><strong>The Experience</strong></strong><br />
my brother took me to trader joes when I went home and we got so much goodies. one of which was this frozen fried fish. i decided to make fish tacos w avocados with them. in my salsa, I added cucumbers, tomatoes, and corn.</p>        </div>

          <p><strong><strong>The Food</strong></strong><br />
i have a similar critique as I did with the burritos. this tasted almost too refreshing and healthy. tacos are supposed to be sloppy and messily delicious. maybe this is another one of those things that I will reserve to eating out for lol. i also don't own mayo and was limited in the sauces I could make</p>        </div>
