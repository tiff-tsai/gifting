          <p><strong><strong>The Experience</strong></strong><br />
I was feeling inspired by my recent braised pork belly over rice, so decided to make the famous Á¥ÖÁáíËÇâ. the process is largely similar but this one uses a lot more sugar to create that glossy red, caramelized color. i had a hard time with this dish because I didn't have the right type of rock sugar that the recipes called for. i ended up having to cook the pork belly for a lot longer than suggested to evaporate the moisture and achieve the right color.</p>        </div>

          <p><strong><strong>The Food</strong></strong><br />
that extra cooking time rendered the meat to be tougher, which was not ideal. the flavors were all there though! i wonder how restaurants make them so tender</p>        </div>
