          <p><strong><strong>The Experience</strong></strong><br />
i was kinda extra with this dish. i had some head/shell-on shrimps, so I did the whole thing where I pan fried the shell and head to release the juices, added water to deglaze, and made that into the sauce. but I ended up adding some tomatoes, which overpowered the flavors, so it was a lot of work for not that much reward lol.</p>        </div>

          <p><strong><strong>The Food</strong></strong><br />
i really like how thin angel hair is, as they stick to the sauce well and soak up the flavor easily. the shrimps were a little flakey, might have to do with that batch. shrimp flavors were there, but not as strong as I had hoped.</p>        </div>
