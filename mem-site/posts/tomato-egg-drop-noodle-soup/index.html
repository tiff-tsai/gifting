          <p><strong><strong>The Experience</strong></strong><br />
I started experimenting with freezing tomatoes right after I buy them (after washing them ofc). they always get mushing really quickly so I found this method to be really good for preserving them when I just want to use them for stock or soups. its really convenient to just take them out of the freezer, add a few crosses, and thaw in warm water. the peels are really easy to remove and the slushy texture makes it really easy to disintegrate for my purposes!</p>
<p>here I first stir-fried the onions and garlic to release the aroma, and then I added the tomatoes and water.</p>        </div>

          <p><strong><strong>The Food</strong></strong><br />
ive always known that i hate vinegar, but I realized that I also am just not a fan of acidic things. i added two tomatoes here and I found that to be too sour for my liking. need to add some sweetness to balance it out next time/ just do 1 tomato.</p>        </div>
