          <p><strong><strong>The Experience</strong></strong><br />
i made mashed potatoes from scratch for the first time when I was in Australia last summer. i was really craving it again this day so decided to buy a whole bag of potatoes to mash! it ended up being way too much lol I had to give some to my friends and my sister. but it was really good!</p>        </div>

          <p><strong><strong>The Food</strong></strong><br />
the mashed potatos had sO MUCH garlic flavor, which I love. the asparagus was a little tough, need to cut off the bottom more next time. the chicken was good, but I don't love the way I seasoned it here. this seasoning is really good for the oyster mushrooms that I added here tho!</p>        </div>
