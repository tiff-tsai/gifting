        hey,
        <br></br>
        if you're reading this, you probably already know that i’m a hopelessly sentimental person who eagerly clings to
        any opportunity to reminisce. if you know that, then you probably also know the tragic irony: i have the memory
        of a goldfish. if it weren’t for my compulsive habit of photographing nearly everything—my breakfast, lunch, and
        dinner, the first ginkgo leaf i spot each year, every squirrel that ventures within six feet--i’d likely have
        forgotten half of my life.

        <br></br>
        so, in an attempt to hold onto my fading memories, i decided to document my travels to taiwan, the country i
        spent half of my life in. the initial idea came from my trip to taiwan with my boyfriend in january 2025. we
        traveled a few cities on the west coast, and i wanted to document it. the idea later came to me that i want this
        to be more than just a documentation of the past, but also
        something that’s living and can be added to in the future.
        <br></br>

        if you are reading this, then you partook in my
        taiwan travel adventures. click around and find memories we’ve made together!
        
        <br></br>

        goofily, <br />
